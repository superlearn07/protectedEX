how will it work-
The encryption happens inside your browser.
The password never leaves your device.
Only the scrambled (encrypted) text is stored or sent.
So even the server (or in our extension’s case, your local storage) never sees your real text or password.
There is no account tied to you.
No email, no user ID.
Just open the app, type, encrypt, save.
Close the tab, and your data is safe because the encryption key (your password) only lives in your head.
If you can read the code, you can verify that:
It really encrypts on your device.
It doesn’t secretly upload passwords.
This is why people say “you don’t have to trust us—read the code yourself.”



Because you encrypt everything before it’s saved, and your password never leaves your browser, no one—not even you without the password—can read your data.


Dual-key mode (advanced):
Require both password + wallet signature






When you save a note, we will:

Take the text you typed.

Take your password.

Derive a strong encryption key from the password using PBKDF2 (a secure key derivation function).

Use AES-GCM encryption to encrypt the text.

Store:
the ciphertext,
the salt (used for deriving the key),
the IV (initialization vector for AES-GCM)
in chrome.storage.local.
